n this project, we would like to develop a web server that can be hosted on an AWS cloud 
platform. The hosted website can be used by any number of users to access information about a 
companyâ€™s stock market and analyze performance within the span of five years

A RedHat Linux (RHEL) will be launched which will act as a web server. The backend Apache 
server with GUI will be configured in the web server. Once the server is deployed in the AWS 
cloud, the contents of the website will be copied to the HTML path using software called FileZilla. 
FileZilla is FTP-based software for transferring contents from a local computer to the root folder 
of the web server.

The website will work well once the public IP address of the web server is hit. Using a domain 
provider to reserve a domain name and software called Cloudflare to resolve DNS. An SSL 
certificate will be issued so that the website will be more secure and encrypted.
